	<h3 class="heading">Tree Features</h3>

	<p>
		At root level this tree shows all the User-, Shared- and Global-Tags
		that have Objects directly assigned or at a lower level of a given Tag
		hierarchy.<br>Each sub node that again has children has the
		option to expand it, which in turn will load the assigned objects or
		the underlying Tags.<br>To refresh the content of a given node
		you can either press the
		<code class="code">F5</code>
		key or select the <em>Refresh</em> action from the node's context
		menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		On Repository Object nodes like <em>Classes</em>, <em>Interfaces</em>,
		etc. you also have the option to execute common things like <em>Running
			ABAP Unit Tests</em>, <em>Executing the Object</em> or just open the
		Object in a different ABAP Project of the current Workspace.
	</p>

	<h4 class="heading">Counter on Root Node</h4>
	The
	<em>Tagged Objects</em> node also displays a counter upon first loading
	of its content. This counter represents all tagged objects of the user.
	<br> That means all tagged objects in global and user scope, and
	also all those tagged objects that are available to the user via
	<em>Shared Tags</em>.
